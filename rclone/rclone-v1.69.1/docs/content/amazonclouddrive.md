# {{< icon "fab fa-amazon" >}} Amazon Drive

Amazon Drive, formerly known as Amazon Cloud Drive, was a cloud storage
service run by Amazon for consumers.

From 2023-12-31, [Amazon Drive has been discontinued](https://www.amazon.com/b?ie=UTF8&node=23943055011)
by Amazon so the Amazon Drive backend has been removed.

You can still use Amazon Photos to access your photos and videos.
