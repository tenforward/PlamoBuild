# rclone config encryption remove

Remove the config file encryption password

## Synopsis

Remove the config file encryption password

This removes the config file encryption, returning it to un-encrypted.

If `--password-command` is in use, this will be called to supply the old config
password.

If the config was not encrypted then no error will be returned and
this command will do nothing.


```
rclone config encryption remove [flags]
```

## Options

```
  -h, --help   help for remove
```

See the [global flags page](/flags/) for global options not listed here.
