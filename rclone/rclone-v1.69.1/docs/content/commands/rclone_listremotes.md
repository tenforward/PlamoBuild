# rclone listremotes

List all the remotes in the config file and defined in environment variables.

## Synopsis


Lists all the available remotes from the config file, or the remotes matching
an optional filter.

Prints the result in human-readable format by default, and as a simple list of
remote names, or if used with flag `--long` a tabular format including
the remote names, types and descriptions. Using flag `--json` produces
machine-readable output instead, which always includes all attributes - including
the source (file or environment).

Result can be filtered by a filter argument which applies to all attributes,
and/or filter flags specific for each attribute. The values must be specified
according to regular rclone filtering pattern syntax.


```
rclone listremotes [<filter>] [flags]
```

      --description string   Filter remotes by description

      --name string          Filter remotes by name
      --order-by string      Instructions on how to order the result, e.g. 'type,name=descending'
      --source string        Filter remotes by source, e.g. 'file' or 'environment'
      --type string          Filter remotes by type
```
